# Sanity Page Builder Example for Gatsby

[Read the blog post for more information](https://www.simeongriggs.dev/create-a-page-builder-in-sanity-for-gatsby).

This repo is based off the [Sanity Gatsby Starter](https://www.sanity.io/create/?template=sanity-io%2Fsanity-template-gatsby-blog), but I have deliberately stripped out anything that is not explicitly useful to the Page Builder being demonstrated.

It is not intended to be a starter, just a working demo of how to setup schema and fields for the page builder website development pattern in Sanity and Gatsby.
